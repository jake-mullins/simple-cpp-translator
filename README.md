# simple-cpp-translator
Learning OOP in a classroom setting is a daunting task, especially for the majority of undergraduates in introductory CS classes, who haven't written a line of code before.

In school, we are taught basic OOP using verbs in our day to day language. For example, we say class A **has a** string called name to mean that there is a member variable in class A called name.

This project aims to create a translator from a simplified, human readable format to compiler-ready C++ code. 

### Current target feature

Basic classes member variables using ```has a``` in the following format

```class Cell has an integer called xCord```

```class Cell has a string called value```

I don't expect this to be used in any other context except for learning.
